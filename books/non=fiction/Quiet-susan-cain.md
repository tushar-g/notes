**The Power of Introverts in a world that can't stop talking  
by Susan Cain**


## Introduction

1. Our lives are shaped by personality as much as byb gender or race.
2. Single most important aspect of Personality is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum.(Ofcourse, accroding to a scientist.)
3. Introversion and Extroversion are two of the most exhaustively researched topics in personality psychology.
4. We are told to be great is to be bold, to be happy is to be sociable. We see ourselves as a nation of extroverts--which means we have lost sight of who we really are.
5. We live with a value system called Extrovert Ideal. The ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in spotlight.
	* This ideal prefers action to contemplation, risk-taking to heed-taking, certainty to doubt. 
	* Prefers quick decisions, even at the risk of being wrong.
	* Works well in teams and socializes easily in groups.
6. We say we prefer individualism, but we mostly prefers only one type of Individual, the Ideal self - the one who is comfortable putting self out there. 
7. Introversion--along with it's cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness--is now a sencond-class personality trait.
8. Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like woman in man's world.
9. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we have turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel, we must conform.
10. We often consider talkative people as smart, more interesting and more desirable as friends. <u>Velocity of speech counts as well as volume.</u>. Fast talkers - more competent, likable. Similarly in a group, volubles are considered smarter than reticent.
11. There is no corelation between gift of the gab and good ideas.
12. In 1921, a psychologist Carl Jung, popularized the terms _Introvert_ & _Extrovert_.
	* Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling; Extroverts to the external life of people and activities. 
	* Introverts focus on the meaning they make of the evetns swirling around them; Extroverts lunge into events themselves.
	* Introverts recharge their batteries by being alone; Extroverts need to recharge when they don't socialize enough.
13. Many psychologists tend to agree on Introverts and Extroverts differing in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well.
	* Introverts feel "just right" with less stimulation like reading a book, sipping wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle. 
	* Extroverts on the other hand enjoy the extra bang that comes from activities like meeting new people, skiing slippery slopes and cranking up the stereo.
14. Psychologists also agree on Introverts and Extroverts working differently. Extroverts tend to tackle assignments quickly. Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately.
15. Our personality often also shape our social styles.
	* Extroverts:
		* Will add life to a dinner party.
		* Laugh generously at your jokes.
		* Tend to be assertive, dominant and in great need of company.
		* Think out loud and on their feet.
		* Prefer talking to listening.
		* Rarely find themselves at a loss of words
		* Comfortable with conflict but not with solitude.
	* Introverts:
		* May have strong social skills and enjoy parties, business meetings but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas.
		* Prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, family.
		* Listen more than they talk.
		* Think before they speak.
		* Hate small talk and enjoy deep discussions.
		* Avoid conflict.
16. Inroverts are not **hermit** and **misanthrope**. They can be these things but most are not.
17. There is no such thing as pure Introvert or pure Extrovert. Partly because we are all gloriously complicated Individuals and also because there are different _kinds_ of Introverts and Extroverts.

#### Introverts and Shyness

1. Introverts are not necessarily shy. 
2. Shyness is the fear of social approval or humiliation where as Introversion is a preference of an environment which is not overstimulating.
3. Shyness is inherently painful.
4. The two are often confused because they often overlap.
5. Scientists have mapped these two on horizontal and vertical axes. Introvert-Extrovert spectrum on horizontal and anxious-stable spectrum on vertical. This gives us four quadrants of personality types: **calm extroverts**, **anxious (or impulsive) extroverts**, **calm introverts** & **anxious introverts**
